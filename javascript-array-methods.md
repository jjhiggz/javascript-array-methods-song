# Javascript array methods rap (Lyrics no code)

Alright, I don't know if I could kill a manatee with my bare hands
But I can definitely write some javascript

With Javascript Array Methods I can rule the world
I know FP so I can steal your girl

Map filter find reduce

When she hear this song she be shaking her kaboose
Start with the array . method like that,
you're girl like an argument, she gon' call back

like to chain my code so I can keep it fly
but I keep it flexible with the function I apply

.find finds the first thing returns true
.filter helps me get rid of all the poo
.map gets me all this gold from crap
and .reduce too complex for this rap

But that's not all if you know what you're doing
you can make your own functions you could be consuming

minBy
maxBy
sortBy
groupBy

You could make it chain-like
if you could make a new pipe

Oh whats that? You're worried bout types?
Turns out typescript lives up to the hype
gotta keep your code holy, program like a cleric
keep the types accurate by using a generic

push it pop it,like a stack 
get that cash, that's a fact

You could pop, unshift it too
That was a line, about a queue

every means that all is true
but you would know that if you came to my school
We don't need to go rehearse,
I'm flipping bars like .reverse

I could rock with .sort.... no lean
even though its still mutative like wolverine
Thank the good lord for ES2023
I use `toSorted` so I can keep my code clean

If you want to keep it nice
use `Array.slice`
but if we in react hope it ain't `.splice`

We got array . at
to easy pick the back
and we got `.join`
come together at last

Uh yeah
Uh yeah
Uh yeah
Uh yeah

That's the array methods rap
